# Create drives for encrypted data-at-rest (EDAR)

## Overview
This Bash script facilitates the creation of encrypted storage drives at rest using LUKS encryption. It provides a user-friendly CLI to select a drive, choose a file system type, and performs the necessary steps for formatting, encrypting, and mounting the encrypted drive.

## Compatibility
- Developed on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- Should be compatible with Debian-based distributions

## Features
- Checks for `cryptsetup` installation and prompts the user to install if not found.
- Allows the user to select a drive from a list of available drives.
- Prompts the user to enter a custom name for the encrypted drive (default includes drive details).
- Offers a selection of common file system types (ext4, xfs, btrfs, f2fs, zfs, vfat).
- Formats, encrypts, and mounts the selected drive using the chosen file system.
- Optionally updates user's `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_logout` for automating drive unlock/lock.
- Provides error handling and exits gracefully on user cancellation or failure.
- Includes comprehensive logging throughout using the system `logger`.

## Requirements
- `cryptsetup`: The script checks for the presence of `cryptsetup` and prompts the user to install it if not found.
- `lsblk`: Used to list available drives and their details.
- `numfmt`: Used to format drive sizes into human-readable units.

## Options
- -h, --help   Display this help message and exit.

## How to Use
1. Make sure the script is executable: `chmod u+x create-edar-drive.sh`
2. Run the script in the terminal: `./create-edar-drive.sh [-h, --help]`
3. Follow the prompts to select a drive, choose a file system, and confirm the formatting process.

## Notes
- ZFS requires additional steps and is currently a placeholder in the script.
